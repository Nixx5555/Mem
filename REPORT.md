**A study of the memory decision policy under a bounded store**

## Abstract

Long-running LLM agents cannot keep every turn of a conversation in context, so
a memory layer must decide what to **keep**, **compress**, **forget** and
**recall**. Production systems (Letta/MemGPT, Mem0, Zep) ship tiered memory with
compression, and the 2026 literature names the decision policy itself as the
open problem. We build MemGate, a policy-agnostic harness that measures memory
policies on a common accuracy-per-token frontier, and use it to ask which part
of a tiered memory system actually earns its cost.

Our central finding is **negative about compression and positive about
selection**. Measured with only the context window bounded — the accounting
used throughout this literature — the tiering machinery is a net loss against
simply keeping every turn and retrieving. We show this is an artefact of leaving
storage unbounded, impose a storage budget, and re-run. Under the corrected
accounting, **choosing which turns to forget is worth +8.7 answer-recall points
over forgetting oldest-first at identical storage, fidelity and retrieval**
(95% CI [+4.8, +14.3] clustered by conversation, McNemar p = 1.1×10⁻⁴), while
**compressing an evicted turn instead of dropping it loses 6.7 points**. The
rate–distortion prediction that compression must eventually win does not hold
anywhere we can reach: we test compression ratios to 182× and the selection
margin *widens* with pressure.

We further show that charging for the embedding index — normally given away
free — inverts the ranking below 64 KiB, where a policy with no index at all
beats every retrieval-based method.

Measured through a fixed local reader over all 715 answer-recoverable
questions, **+6.0 of those +8.7 points survive as correct answers** (95% CI
[+3.3, +9.1] clustered by conversation) — 69% of the ceiling gap — against a
closed-book floor of 1.7%.

## 1. Problem

A 200K-token context window did not solve agent memory; it relocated the
problem.

* **Context rot.** Chroma Research (2025) tested 18 frontier models: accuracy
  degrades 30–50% well before the documented context limit. It is a property of
  attention, not a training gap, so larger windows do not fix it — curation does.
* **Cost and latency.** On LoCoMo, full context is ~26,000 tokens and 9.87 s
  median latency; selective memory reaches similar accuracy at ~1,800 tokens and
  0.71 s — roughly 14× cheaper.
* **The measurable gap.** On LongMemEval, oracle retrieval scores ~92% where the
  same model interactively scores ~58%. That 34-point gap is memory *selection*
  failure, not reasoning failure.

Tiered memory with forgetting is already shipped. The open problem, named
explicitly in a 2026 review, is that current systems *"do not solve the
fundamental challenge: deciding what to remember and what to forget."*
Colaco & Lahjouji (2026) frame all such decisions as one rate–distortion
problem — what to retain, at what fidelity, under a budget — but supply a
framework, not a system. **That gap is this project.**

### Research question

> How much of the memory-selection gap can a better decision policy recover,
> and under what budget does compression pay for itself?

## 2. Method

MemGate wraps a frozen LLM and controls what enters the prompt. Nothing is
trained; the base model is a black box.

### 2.1 Architecture

Three tiers, as a **lifecycle rather than a partition** — everything enters
Tier 1, and the routing decision happens on eviction, when each item is scored
exactly once:

| Tier | Holds | Criterion | In context? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 short-term | raw verbatim turns | **when** — recent? | always |
| 2 working | compressed gists | **gist** — continuity? | always (small) |
| 3 long-term | atomic facts + vectors | **what** — durable? | on retrieval match |

### 2.2 Policies compared

| | Policy | Retention rule | Fidelity |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | Sliding window | recency, budget-driven | verbatim |
| RAG | Store-all + retrieve | FIFO (the no-policy control) | verbatim |
| P1 | MemGate threshold | score at ingest, τ-routed | compressed |
| **P1-A** | MemGate adaptive | score orders eviction | **compress** on eviction |
| **P1-S** | MemGate select | score orders eviction | **drop** on eviction |
| P3 | Learned scorer | fitted, cross-validated | drop |
| Oracle | — | perfect selection (bound) | verbatim |

The comparisons are constructed so each isolates **one** variable:

| Comparison | Held constant | Varies |
|---|---|---|
| P0 vs RAG | retention, storage | **read path** — recency vs retrieval |
| RAG vs P1-S | storage, fidelity, retrieval | **which turns are forgotten** |
| P1-S vs P1-A | storage, selection | **fidelity** — drop vs compress |

### 2.3 Metrics

* **Evidence (strict) recall** — every gold evidence turn reached the context.
  A multi-hop question cites up to 19 turns and 18 of 19 answers nothing.
* **Answer recall** — the answer *text* survived, scored over the 715 questions
  whose answer is recoverable from evidence text. **This is the metric to
  believe.** Evidence recall credits a compressed gist for ids whose text it
  discarded; answer recall does not.
* **Stored tokens / bytes** — what the policy still holds, as opposed to what it
  spends per query.

Reporting both is essential rather than decorative: the two metrics *disagree*
on exactly the comparison the project is about, and the disagreement is the
finding (§3.2).

### 2.4 Benchmark

LoCoMo (Maharana et al., 2024): 10 conversations, 5,882 turns, 1,527 scoreable
questions. Adversarial items (category 5) are excluded — they carry evidence,
but the correct behaviour is to decline, so retrieving it is not success.
Embedder: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384-d). Tokenizer: tiktoken `cl100k_base`.
P2 judge: Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct, run locally.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Storage was never budgeted, and that determined the answer

Every experiment in this literature, and every one of ours through §22 of the
working record, caps the **context** per query and leaves the **store**
unbounded. Under that accounting "keep everything and retrieve top-k" is
charged nothing for holding all 419 turns of a conversation, so forgetting can
only ever lose information. Our own ablation duly reported the compression
machinery as a **net loss** against keeping everything — and it was right to.

Imposing a storage budget S changes the question from "what fits in context?"
to "what is worth keeping at all?"

### 3.2 Selection pays; compression does not

Context budget fixed at 2048 tokens; storage budget swept. Answer recall:

| S (tokens) | RAG store-all | P1-A adaptive *(compress)* | **P1-S select** *(drop)* |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1024 | 9.1% | 10.9% | **15.7%** |
| 2048 | 18.3% | 23.4% | **26.3%** |
| 4096 | 28.1% | 30.1% | **36.8%** |
| 8192 | 44.3% | 37.5% | **48.3%** |
| 16384 | 66.4% | 66.4% | **72.3%** |

**The two metrics disagree, and that is the result.** P1-A *wins* evidence
recall (+12.9 at S=8192) while *losing* answer recall (−6.9). A demoted gist
keeps the evidence ids of a turn whose text it has thrown away. Evidence recall
credits the pointer; answer recall checks the content. Reporting only the
former would have shown compression winning.

**RAG and P1-S hold the same verbatim turns, in the same space, retrieved the
same way, and differ in one respect only: which turns they forget when the cap
binds.** RAG forgets oldest-first; P1-S forgets lowest-utility-first. That gap
is the decision policy and nothing else.

### 3.3 Statistical significance

Paired bootstrap (B=10,000), clustered by conversation, with exact McNemar.
Clustering matters: 1,527 questions from 10 conversations are not 1,527
independent trials.

| Comparison | Metric | Δ | 95% CI (clustered) | McNemar p |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1-S vs RAG | **answer** | **+8.67** | **[+4.77, +14.27]** | 1.1×10⁻⁴ |
| P1-S vs RAG | evidence | +1.96 | [−1.48, +5.52] | 0.16 **(n.s.)** |
| P1-S vs P1-A | answer | +6.71 | [+4.24, +9.54] | 3.6×10⁻⁵ |
| P1-S vs P1-A | evidence | −10.74 | [−13.65, −7.90] | 4.7×10⁻²⁰ |
| P1-S vs P0 | answer | +18.46 | [+14.68, +23.56] | 3.8×10⁻¹⁷ |

**We do not claim an evidence-recall improvement over RAG** — it does not
survive clustering. The answer-recall claim does.

### 3.4 The rate–distortion prediction fails

Theory predicts compression must eventually beat selection: squeeze the store
hard enough and a lossy record must beat no record. Sweeping S downward cannot
test this — by S=256 every policy is at ~0.2% evidence recall, below the floor
where anything works. The missing axis is conversation **length**, so we
concatenate up to 10 LoCoMo conversations (186K tokens) and hold S fixed.

Answer recall at S=2048, by compression ratio:

| Ratio | RAG | P1-A *(compress)* | **P1-S** *(drop)* |
|---|---|---|---|
| 9× | 18.3% | 23.4% | **26.3%** |
| 18× | 10.8% | 14.7% | **18.2%** |
| 45× | 7.8% | 11.2% | **11.7%** |
| 91× | 4.6% | 6.0% | **8.7%** |

**No crossover to 182×**, and the selection margin over RAG *widens* with
pressure. At LoCoMo scale the optimum sits at the vertex: a subset at full
fidelity beats everything at reduced fidelity.

*Caveat:* a concatenated stream is not a natural long conversation. Each
question concerns one constituent conversation, so the others act as
distractors. It is a stress test of retention under pressure — the variable
under study — not a long-dialogue benchmark.

### 3.5 The index is not free

Storage is normally denominated in text tokens, which silently gives the
embedding index away. A 384-d float32 vector is 1,536 B against a turn's ~130 B
of text: the index outweighs the content ~12×, and the binding cost becomes the
**number of items**, not their length.

Answer recall under byte accounting:

| Budget | P0 *(no index)* | RAG | P1-S select |
|---|---|---|---|
| 32 KiB | **18.3%** | 5.0% | 15.1% |
| 64 KiB | 18.3% | 11.0% | **22.5%** |
| 256 KiB | 18.3% | 33.0% | **39.0%** |

Two results. The §3.2 conclusion is **unit-robust** — selection still beats
compression, by +7.8 to +34.0. And **below ~40 KiB an embedding index cannot
earn its own storage**: plain recency, which keeps no vectors, wins outright.
That regime is invisible when the budget counts text alone.

### 3.6 The scorer is the bottleneck, and it is learnable

Ablation at S=4096 (adaptive mode), evidence recall:

| Removed | Δ |
|---|---|
| retrieval (Tier 3) | **−30.3** |
| demotion on pressure | −10.7 *(but answer recall **+6.7**)* |
| scored eviction → FIFO | **−5.0** |
| informative compressor | −3.8 |
| consolidation merge | −2.6 |
| supersession | −0.2 |

Replacing P1's hand-chosen weights with a fitted model, under
leave-one-conversation-out (the model scoring a conversation never saw it in
training):

| Scorer | AUC | Answer recall |
|---|---|---|
| P1 heuristic (hand-tuned) | — | 26.3% |
| P3 learned, hand features | 0.746 | 27.7% |
| **P3 learned, + MiniLM** | **0.793** | **31.5%** |

The fitted weights say something the heuristic never encoded: **turn length is
the strongest single predictor of evidence-worthiness**, ahead of every
hand-designed cue.

P3-learned is **not deployable** — a live agent has no future questions to
learn from. It bounds the headroom of a learned decision policy, with the
Oracle above it and P1 below.

### 3.7 An LLM judge is the wrong instrument for salience

The obvious way to improve the scorer is to ask a language model. We ran it as
a **single-component swap**: policy, storage budget, retrieval and compression
pinned at the §3.2 winner (P1-S, context 2048, store 4096), only the scorer
varying. The judge is Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct, read as a continuous expectation
over digit-token logits at one forward pass rather than by generating and
parsing a digit — faster, unparseable-by-construction, and continuous, so
eviction ranking has no ties.

| Scorer | Evidence | Answer | Δ vs P1 | 95% CI (clustered) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0 recency (no content judgement) | 12.6% | 25.6% | −11.19 | [−17.24, −6.19] |
| **P1 heuristic** (regex + shallow NER) | 19.8% | **36.8%** | — | — |
| P2 LLM judge (Qwen2.5-0.5B) | 14.0% | 30.9% | **−5.87** | [−10.77, −1.76] |
| P3 learned (LOCO, bound) | 33.4% | 48.3% | +11.47 | [+4.90, +17.86] |

**The judge loses to the regex by 5.87 points, and the interval excludes
zero.** This is a genuine negative result rather than a null one, and it is not
a matter of the model being small in the abstract: the same table shows the
headroom is real (+11.47 to the learned bound), so the ceiling P2 failed to
reach genuinely exists.

The diagnosis is in what the judge is shown. It rates each turn **in
isolation**, and salience is not a property of a turn on its own — a phone
number matters because something later asks for it. The learned scorer, given
the same isolated text, does better precisely because it was fitted to which
turns *turned out* to be cited, absorbing the corpus-level base rates the judge
has no way to see. That an LLM prompted per-turn underperforms a regex, at
~15 minutes of GPU per corpus against microseconds, is worth stating plainly.

### 3.8 The gap survives a real reader

Every result above is context recall, which is the *ceiling* on accuracy rather
than accuracy. Each assembled context is now sent through one fixed reader
(Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-4bit, greedy, 32 new tokens) and scored with the same
normaliser the answer metric applies to the context, so "the answer reached the
context" and "the answer reached the output" are one predicate applied at two
points. All 715 answer-recoverable questions, with two controls.

| Arm | Accuracy | F1 | Answer present | Acc. given present |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| closed-book *(floor)* | 1.7% | 5.0 | 0.0% | — |
| P0 sliding window | 8.3% | 11.9 | 18.3% | 40.5% |
| RAG store-all | 12.4% | 17.7 | 28.1% | 42.3% |
| P1-A adaptive *(compress)* | 13.1% | 19.9 | 30.1% | 42.3% |
| **P1-S select** *(drop)* | **18.5%** | 24.7 | 36.8% | 49.4% |
| Oracle *(ceiling)* | 67.3% | 75.7 | 100.0% | 67.3% |

| | |
|---|---|
| ceiling gap (answer recall) | +8.7 pts |
| **realised gap (accuracy)** | **+6.0 pts**, 95% CI [+3.3, +9.1] clustered |
| conversion | **69%** of the ceiling gap |

**The closed-book floor is 1.7%**, so parametric knowledge contributes almost
nothing here and the margin above it is the memory layer. The advantage arrives
through both available routes: P1-S puts the answer in context more often
(36.8% vs 28.1%), *and* the contexts it assembles are used more successfully
when it does (49.4% vs 42.3%). Accuracy given the answer was **absent** is below
1% for every arm, which is what a reader that does not guess its way to credit
looks like.

The oracle converts a complete context into a correct answer only 67.3% of the
time. That bounds what any memory policy can deliver through this reader, and
places the remaining headroom in the reader rather than in the memory layer.

### 3.9 The headline does not transfer to a second benchmark

LoCoMo is ten conversations. A claim that holds only on the corpus its scorer
was tuned against is not a claim, so the §3.3 result was re-run on **LongMemEval**
— 94 independent haystacks of 38–62 sessions, ~500 turns each. The store budget
was swept to put LongMemEval at LoCoMo's retention (22.1% against 22.0%).

| Store | Retention | P1-S select | RAG store-all | Selection − FIFO (answer) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 4,096 | 3.9% | 14.5% | 9.7% | +4.84 [−3.23, +12.90] n.s. |
| 8,192 | 7.9% | 22.6% | 14.5% | +8.06 [−1.61, +17.74] n.s. |
| 16,384 | 15.7% | 21.0% | 27.4% | −6.45 [−17.74, +4.84] n.s. |
| **23,000** | **22.1%** | **19.4%** | **40.3%** | **−20.97 [−33.87, −8.06] significant** |
| **32,768** | **31.4%** | **30.6%** | **51.6%** | **−20.97 [−35.48, −6.45] significant** |

**It does not replicate.** At matched retention selection *loses* to FIFO by
20.97 answer points where LoCoMo gives +8.67, and the deficit is the same −20.97
at the next budget up. Both arms improve with storage — P1-S 14.5% → 30.6%, RAG
9.7% → 51.6% — so selection is not failing to use the space. It is using it
consistently less well than plain FIFO.

**The cause is the scorer, not the mechanism.** Scoring evidence against
non-evidence turns directly, with no policy or store involved:

| | evidence | non-evidence | separation |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| LoCoMo | 0.2484 | 0.2008 | **+0.0476** |
| LongMemEval | 0.3727 | 0.4074 | **−0.0346** |

The separation **reverses sign**. Eviction orders on that utility, so on
LongMemEval it discards evidence first and loses to no ranking at all. The
heuristic was written for LoCoMo's 32-token dialogue lines, dense in
regex-catchable cues; LongMemEval's turns are 209.6-token conversational prose.
This is consistent with §3.6, where the fitted scorer's strongest single feature
is turn length — a corpus-level regularity rather than a semantic one.

**The obvious confound was checked and is not load-bearing.**
`MemGatePolicy.build_context` reserves 25% of the context for Tier-1 recency
before retrieval is consulted; `RAGPolicy` reserves nothing, so the contrast was
not the single-variable comparison it claimed. Removing the reservation
(`run_lme_split.py`) moved the answer metric by **exactly zero** — +0.00, CI
[+0.00, +0.00], identical outcomes on all 62 answer-recoverable questions.
Selection loses by 20.97 either way.

**Two cautions on reading this.** The answer metric rests on 62
answer-recoverable questions. And **strict recall is uninterpretable here for a
compressing arm**: a gist carries the evidence id of text it discarded, which is
exactly what §3.2's answer-presence metric exists to catch. P1-A's 54.3% strict
against P1-S's 3.2% is identifier bookkeeping. Answer recall is unaffected.

What §3.3 claims is therefore bounded: **+8.67 is what a decision policy
recovers given a scorer suited to the corpus**, not a property of scored
selection in general.

### 3.10 A better compressor helps, and still loses to dropping

§3.2's negative result is stated for *extractive* compression: P1-A selects
words from an evicted turn but does not rewrite it. Replacing that one component
with a 1.5B model that rewrites each evicted turn — everything else held at
§3.2's configuration — tests whether the finding was about compression or about
the compressor.

| Arm | Evidence recall | Answer recall | Time |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| RAG store-all | 17.8% | 28.1% | 0.5 s |
| P1-A extractive | 30.5% | 30.1% | 76 s |
| P1-A abstractive | 32.3% | 34.1% | 3,892 s |
| **P1-S select** | 19.8% | **36.8%** | **2.1 s** |

| Contrast (answer recall) | Δ | 95% CI | |
|---|---:|---|---|
| abstractive − extractive | **+4.06** | [+0.84, +6.66] | significant |
| select − extractive | **+6.71** | [+4.26, +9.50] | significant |

**Both halves matter.** Rewriting beats word-selection by 4.06 points, so part of
§3.2's result was the compressor rather than compression — a correction to our
own claim. But dropping still beats rewriting, 36.8% against 34.1%, so the
optimum remains at the vertex.

The cost asymmetry is the practical finding: 4,879 generations and 3,892 seconds
to finish 2.7 points *behind* a policy that takes 2.1 seconds and simply forgets.
§3.4's crossover is not reached on the fidelity axis either.

This supersedes the earlier one-conversation pilot, whose intervals were
degenerate — a single cluster leaves the paired bootstrap nothing to resample —
and whose significance column was an artefact of that.

---

### 3.11 Online learning reaches parity with the hand-written heuristic

§3.6's fitted scorer is an upper bound: it is trained on which turns were in
fact cited, which a live agent cannot know. P4 replaces that with a label-free
runtime signal — it updates from retrieval feedback every 25 turns, using no
future questions. Policy, budgets and retrieval are pinned at §3.3's
configuration, so only the scorer varies.

| Scorer | Evidence recall | Answer recall | vs heuristic (answer) |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| P0 recency (unscored) | 12.6% | 25.6% | −11.19 [−17.30, −6.21] significant |
| P1 heuristic | 19.8% | 36.8% | — |
| P4 online | 18.4% | 35.2% | **−1.54 [−4.63, +0.79] n.s.** |

n = 1,527 questions / 715 answer-recoverable, clustered over ten conversations;
1,233 updates at α = 0.76.

**P4 matches the heuristic** — the interval straddles zero — while needing no
hand-picked cues and no labels. It does not reach §3.6's fitted 48.3%, and the
distance between them is the price of not having an oracle.

The weights it learned are worth reporting, because they bear on §3.9:

```
ends_period  -0.529     is_question  +0.352
n_words      -0.372     has_month    +0.202
n_caps       -0.320     has_digit    -0.216
```

It learned to *disfavour* long turns and sentence-final punctuation. That is
correct on LoCoMo, whose evidence turns are short factual lines. On
LongMemEval, where every turn is ~210-token prose ending in a period, these same
weights point the wrong way — so P4 is a candidate for fixing §3.9's transfer
failure only if it is allowed to re-learn per corpus. Untested, and the obvious
next experiment.

## 4. Methodological findings

Three of this project's most useful results are about *measurement*, and each
was caught by a guard rather than by inspection.

**4.1 A policy that reads its own answer key.** `fact_id` is an evaluation
label. An early consolidation rule promoted items on `it.fact_id`, i.e. the
policy consulted the answer key when deciding what to keep. It was worth
**+45 to +47 recall points** and invalidated the first review's headline
(95% → 50%). The fix is a test, not a comment: strip every label from the input
and the store must come out bit-identical. Each new decision point — eviction
and demotion included — is added to that test before its numbers are quoted.

**4.2 A component's measured value is conditional on the bottleneck being
elsewhere.** We measured the MiniLM embedder as worth +0.2 points and concluded
it barely mattered. That was true *in the regime measured*: retrieval was
saturated against a write path discarding 93% of the conversation. Once that
ceiling was removed, the same swap was worth **+19.7**. Ablations run against a
broken pipeline systematically undervalue exactly the components that would
matter once it is fixed.

**4.3 A metric that credits pointers.** Evidence recall counts a turn as
retrieved if its *id* reaches the context. A compressed gist keeps the id and
discards the text, so it scores a hit with none of the answer behind it. During
the consolidation work, evidence recall rose 8.1% → 14.8% while answer recall
stayed pinned at 12.8% — the entire gain was bookkeeping. Answer-presence
scoring is what separated selection from compression in §3.2.

A fourth, smaller instance: batched judge scoring returned NaN for exactly the
short turns. The instinct was precision, and float32 did not fix it; the cause
was left-padding creating fully-masked attention rows. A NaN guard surfaced it.
Without that guard every filler turn would have scored NaN and quietly inverted
the eviction order.

## 5. Limitations

* **10 conversations.** Clustered intervals are wide because the cluster count
  is small. Effects are reported with those intervals, and the one that does
  not survive clustering is reported as not significant.
* **A single reader model.** §3.8 uses one 1.5B four-bit model decoding
  greedily. The *ordering* of policies is what we claim; the absolute
  accuracies are properties of that reader, and the oracle's 67.3% shows much
  of the remaining error is the reader rather than the memory layer.
* **Compression was tested in both forms** (§3.10). A rewriting summariser is
  worth +4.06 answer points over word-selection, so part of the negative result
  was the compressor; it still loses to dropping by 2.7 points at 1,850× the
  cost. What is untested is a larger summariser.
* **Concatenated streams are synthetic** (§3.4) — now superseded by the
  LongMemEval run of §3.9, which uses natural long histories.
* **The scorer is tuned to this corpus** (§3.9). Its separation between evidence
  and non-evidence turns reverses sign on LongMemEval, and scored eviction
  consequently loses to FIFO there. Whether the mechanism or only this scorer
  fails to transfer is open, and is the most urgent remaining question.
* **P3-learned is a headroom bound, not a component** (§3.6).
* **Single embedder and single judge model.** Both are ablated but neither is
  varied across families. The §3.7 negative is therefore evidence about *a 0.5B
  model prompted per-turn*, not about LLM judging in general; a larger model, or
  one shown the surrounding turns, is untested.

## 6. Conclusion

Presented as "a memory layer with three tiers", this work would have been
already done. Measured honestly, the more useful result is what *doesn't* work:

1. With storage unbounded — the standard accounting — tiered compression is a
   net loss against keeping everything and retrieving.
2. With storage bounded, **the decision policy is worth +8.7 answer-recall
   points at identical storage, fidelity and retrieval**, while **compression
   still loses 6.7 points**.
3. The rate–distortion crossover at which compression should pay is not
   reachable on this benchmark — to 182× compression, keeping a selected subset
   whole beats compressing everything.
4. Charging for the embedding index inverts the ranking below ~40 KiB.
5. Through a real reader, **+6.0 of the +8.7 points are realised as correct
   answers** — 69% of the ceiling gap — so the advantage is not merely
   available, it is delivered.

**Practical guidance: keep a scored subset whole; do not compress everything.**
And denominate the budget in bytes, including the index, or the comparison is
not the one you think you are making.

### Future work

* A larger reader, to separate the memory layer's remaining headroom from the
  reader's (the oracle arm converts only 67.3% of complete contexts).
* Abstractive compression, to test whether §3.4's negative result is specific to
  extractive methods.
* A benchmark with genuinely long single conversations (LongMemEval).
* Online learning of the eviction policy from interaction, which would make a
  learned scorer deployable.

python3 run_cost_model.py        # §3.5 byte accounting
python3 run_significance.py      # §3.3 bootstrap + McNemar
python3 train_scorer.py          # §3.6 learned scorer
python3 precompute_judge.py      # P2 judge scores (local model, ~15 min, cached)
python3 run_judge_eval.py        # §3.7 scorer comparison + CIs
python3 run_endtask.py           # §3.8 end-task accuracy (~50 min, resumable)
