# Rebuild the Overleaf upload bundle.
#
# There is no TeX distribution on the development machine and Homebrew cannot
# reach ghcr.io from this network, so the paper is compiled on Overleaf rather
# than locally. This produces the zip to upload.
#
#   sh paper/bundle.sh
#
# Then: overleaf.com -> New Project -> Upload Project -> pick the zip,
# set Compiler = pdfLaTeX and Main document = main.tex (conference) or
# journal.tex (journal).
